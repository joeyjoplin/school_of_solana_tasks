# School of Solana Season 8 #
## What's this all about? ##
Do you want to learn Rust and be able to code, debug, and review Solana programs?</br>
If you are interested in blockchain & crypto and already have previous knowledge in any programming language, enroll in the School of Solana and get certified by Ackee Blockchain Security.</br>
## Lectures ## 
### Introduction to Solana and Blockchain ###
Proof of History, Sealevel and other Solana fundamentals. We will also go through a proper local development setup to get you started in this course.
### Introduction to Rust ###
A gentle introduction to Rust programming language.</br> 
Principles behind Rust and how they tie to Solana program development.Introduction to Anchor development framework and how it helps developers and contributes to security of on-chain programs.
### Solana programming model I & II ###
Let's start developing on-chain Solana programs using Anchor framework.</br>
You'll understand how programs store data and state on the Solana blockchain.</br>
We will go through all important core concepts of Solana development : Accounts structure, Program Derived Addresses, Handling errors & Cross-Program Invocations.
### Best development practices and debugging ###
Develop like a pro! In this lecture, we will show you some of the best development</br>
practices and give you tips and tricks on debugging your programs so you can get up to speed quickly.
### Front-end for Solana Programs ###
Make your program alive! This lecture will show how to implement a simple front-end for our Bank app using the official Solana scaffold.
### Solana Security ###
Hackers away! This lecture will introduce common vulnerability issues in Solana programs, how they can be exploited and most importantly, how you can avoid them.
